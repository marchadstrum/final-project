       <div> They told me this day would come, </div>
     <div>  just like the Mayan Calendar in 2012. </div>
     <div>  I did not believe them </div>
     <div>  didn't want to say goodbye,</div>
      <div> but people drift through life </div>
      <div> just like a beautiful sunset </div>
      <div> and it's through their impermanence </div>
      <div> that we love them. </div>
      <div> Throw her ashes into the sea </div>
     <div>  and let her spirit fly free. </div>
      <div> I accept my mortality </div>
      <div>  hope it changes my mentality. </div>
      <div> You wrote me letters </div>
      <div> when I was in first grade, </div>
      <div> just learning </div>
      <div> how to read and write,</div> 
      <div> I never answered them. </div>
      <div> Dear Grandma Elsie, </div>
      <div> I am six years old now, </div>
      <div> and I like ice cream and movies with Greta Garbo. </div>
